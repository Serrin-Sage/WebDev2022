                                I grew up watching the Original Trilogy of Star Wars and I instanstly fell in love with the story, lore, and visuals. As a kid these movies were incredible and I din't think anything could be this cool! As an adult I still love Star Wars but as a fan I recognize that the franchise has been all over the place and the movies are not the most incredible things ever made. I am able to recognize the absurdity of it all but I'll never stop liking Star Wars. Star Wars follows the Skywalker family in a galaxy far far away, it is a space epic drama that honestly is hard to explain. The main focus is on good and evil and which prevail in the face of adversity. The first movie was released in 1977 and the final movie in the Skywalker saga came out in 2019. There are 9 movies total in the saga but Star Wars media is all encompassing. There are books, video games, tv shows, and comic books that expand the lore and intrigue of the Star Wars story.
